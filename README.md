# Advanced Finite Element Modeling and Analysis in C++ with deal.II Library
This repository contains the code for my final project in the ME413 - Introduction to Finite Element Analysis course, which I took during the final term of my mechanical engineering studies. Additionally, it includes an unfinished report. When I started this project, I had no prior knowledge of C++, so I had to invest a lot of time and effort into it. In the end, I can confidently say that the code works well enough to earn the highest possible grade. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to complete the report, which I wrote using LaTeX (a tool I used for the first time in this project). I could have skipped some details, but I really enjoyed creating a high-quality report. However, all the visuals are included, and the theoretical sections are mostly finished. Maybe one day, I’ll have the time to analyze the results and complete the conclusion section.
